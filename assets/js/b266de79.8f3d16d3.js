My token budget just hit zero. Claude Code is asking me the same question for the fourth time: \\"What coding style does this project use?\\" I\'ve spent 6 hours being a glorified copy-paste machine, explaining the same context over and over.*\\n\\n*Sound familiar?*\\n\\nThat night, I realized something critical: **Claude Code is teachable**. But I was the worst teacher on Earth.\\n\\n## Day 1: Fighting Claude Code (The Problem)\\n\\nEvery conversation was Groundhog Day:\\n\\n- \\"What\'s our testing framework again?\\"\\n- \\"How do we name files in this project?\\"  \\n- \\"What\'s the deployment process?\\"\\n\\nI was Claude Code\'s personal Wikipedia. **This had to change.**\\n\\n## Day 2: The Teaching Template (The Mentor)\\n\\n> What if Claude Code could remember your project like a team member who\'s been there for years?\\n\\nInstead of explaining everything every time, I wrote a template. The gist is:\\n\\n```md\\n# Communication: Be concise, reference past learnings from docs/work/\\n# File Naming: YYYY-MM-DD-[001]-[category]-[summary].md  \\n# Never code without checking docs/work/ for similar past solutions\\n```\\n\\nThat\'s it. **This eliminated hours of repetitive context.**\\n\\n<MinimalDetails summary=\\"See the prompt \u2192\\">\\n\\n```md\\n# Project: [Your Project Name]\\n\\n## Tech Stack & Tooling\\n- **Language**: Python 3.11+\\n- **Package Manager**: `uv` (use `uv add <dependency>`, `uv run <script>`)\\n- **Testing**: pytest with coverage\\n- **Linting**: ruff + mypy\\n\\n## Systematic File Naming\\nFormat: `YYYY-MM-DD-[001-999]-[category]-[four-word-summary].md`\\nFolder: `docs/work/`\\nCategories: `bug` | `feature` | `task` | `research` | `learnings`\\n\\nExamples:\\n- `2025-07-18-001-feature-user-authentication-system.md`\\n- `2025-07-18-002-bug-database-connection-timeout.md`\\n\\n## Communication Style\\n- **Concise**: No fluff, direct responses\\n- **Evidence-based**: Show, don\'t just tell\\n- **Contextual**: Reference past learnings from `docs/work/`\\n\\n## Planning Protocol\\n1. **Context Gathering**: Check `docs/work/` for relevant past decisions\\n2. **Assumption Documentation**: Explicit assumptions in plan files\\n3. **Execution Gate**: Only proceed after planning is complete\\n```\\n\\n</MinimalDetails>\\n\\n**The transformation was instant.** Claude Code started referencing past decisions, avoiding repeated mistakes, and building on previous work. **It finally felt like working with a teammate.**\\n\\n## Day 3: The Learning Moment - 30% context - (The Training)\\n\\n> What if Claude Code could learn from every mistake and never repeat it?\\n\\nWhen your context hits 30%, you have one chance to crystallize everything learned. Miss it, and you go back to day 1.\\n\\n\\n\\n<MinimalDetails summary=\\"See the prompt \u2192\\">\\n\\n```md\\n\\nWhen context drops below 30%: \\n\\n1. Document every decision made\\n2. List what failed (with code snippets)  \\n3. Note what worked brilliantly\\n4. Write handoff notes for next session\\n\\nUse the `Systematic File Naming` given above.\\n```\\n\\n</MinimalDetails>\\n\\n\\n## Day 4: The Autonomous Engineer (The Victory)\\n\\nI saw this tweet - [@svs used Claude Code as an MCP client to write an MCP server](https://x.com/_svs_/status/1928753160337637726). \\n\\nSomething magical discovered: **When put in verifiable workflows, Claude Code started working much better!**:\\n\\n- Write code \u2192 Run tests \u2192 Fix failures \u2192 Repeat\\n- Build feature \u2192 Deploy to staging \u2192 Check logs \u2192 Iterate  \\n- Analyze data \u2192 Generate insights \u2192 Verify against sources \u2192 Summarize\\n\\n**I wasn\'t micromanaging anymore. I was collaborating.**\\n\\n## Stories from other folks\\n\\nMet awesome folks at [Fifth Elephant Conference](https://hasgeek.com/fifthelephant/2025/) where we shared claude code learnings.\\n\\n<TipsSection contributor=\\"Rajesh\\" contributorUrl=\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/codingnirvana/\\">\\n\\n### The Token Budget Hack That Doubled My Productivity\\n\\nRajesh was burning through tokens like crazy at his startup. Then he discovered something weird about Claude\'s [5-hour windows](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/11145838-using-claude-code-with-your-pro-or-max-plan).\\n\\n**His discovery:** Start sessions at 7 AM instead of 9 AM.\\n\\nWhy? The overlapping windows create a \\"double token zone\\" during peak hours:\\n\\n**Before:** 9am-2pm, 2pm-7pm (standard)  \\n**After:** 7am-12pm, 12pm-5pm, 5pm-10pm (overlapping)\\n\\n**Result:** Between 9am-5pm = **double tokens available**\\n\\n\\n\\n<img src=\\"/img/timeline.svg\\" />\\n\\n\\n\\n### The CSV Strategy That Saved Hours\\n\\nRajesh\'s team was dealing with lots of data analysis requests. CSV files everywhere. Claude kept hitting context limits trying to process raw data.\\n\\n**The breakthrough:** Stop feeding Claude data. Feed it scripts.\\n\\n**Old way:** \\"Here\'s a 10MB CSV, analyze it\\"  \\n**New way:** \\"Write a script to analyze this CSV type, then run it\\"\\n\\n**Why it works:** Scripts are tiny. Results are focused. Claude guides itself using its own analysis output. \\n\\n</TipsSection>\\n\\n<TipsSection contributor=\\"Ashwant\\" contributorUrl=\\"https://www.shelfradar.ai/\\">\\n\\n### The Accidental Discovery That Changed Everything\\n\\nAshwant was debugging a frustrating session. In a moment of rage, he accidentally hit ESC four times.\\n\\n**What happened next blew his mind.**\\n\\nClaude Code showed him a prompt history he\'d never seen before. Every conversation. Every context. **Time travel for developers.**\\n\\n**The magic combo:** ESC + ESC + ESC + ESC = Prompt history navigation\\n\\n**Game changer:** You can resurrect any previous session state instantly.\\n\\n### Claude Code as Your Database Whisperer\\n\\nAt ShelfRadar, Ashwant deployed Claude Code as their internal SQL agent. \\n\\n**The setup:** Claude Code + database schema = autonomous query optimizer\\n\\n**The result:** \\n\\n- Ad-hoc queries refined automatically\\n- Schema changes don\'t break queries  \\n- Claude evolves with your database\\n\\n</TipsSection>\\n\\n**The question isn\'t whether Claude Code is teachable.**  \\n**The question is: Are you ready to become its teacher?**\\n\\nUpdate 1: Claude code introduced hooks. Here is a short collection of hooks that I find useful for my workflow.\\n\\n1. bash script to notify the end of claude code turns. \\n\\n\\n<MinimalDetails summary=\\"Full bash script \u2192\\">\\n```bash\\n#!/bin/bash\\n\\n# Read hook input data\\nINPUT=$(cat)\\nSESSION_DIR=$(basename \\"$(pwd)\\")\\n\\n# Extract message from transcript if available\\nTRANSCRIPT_PATH=$(echo \\"$INPUT\\" | jq -r \'.transcript_path\')\\nif [ -f \\"$TRANSCRIPT_PATH\\" ]; then\\n  MSG=$(tail -10 \\"$TRANSCRIPT_PATH\\" |\\n    jq -r \'select(.message.role == \\"assistant\\") | .message.content[0].text\' |\\n    tail -1 | tr \'\\\\n\' \' \' | cut -c1-60)\\n  MSG=${MSG:-\\"Task completed\\"}\\nelse\\n  MSG=\\"Task completed\\"\\nfi\\n\\n# Show Linux desktop notification (requires notify-send)\\nnotify-send \\"Claude Code ($SESSION_DIR) Done\\" \\"$MSG\\"\\n```\\n\\n</MinimalDetails>\\n\\n<ScriptAttribution\\n  title=\\"Useful Claude Code Hooks & Scripts\\"\\n  description=\\"\\"\\n  links={[\\n    {\\n      url: \\"https://gist.github.com/glennmatlin/fadc41edc3bb9ff68ff9cfa5d6b8aca7\\",\\n      title: \\"Making Claude use uv instead of pip\\",\\n      description: \\"Script for making Claude use uv package manager instead of pip\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      url: \\"https://conductor.build/\\",\\n      title: \\"Running multiple Claude Code sessions in parallel\\",\\n      description: \\"Using git worktrees for parallel Claude Code sessions\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      url: \\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1loodjn/claude_code_now_supports_hooks/\\",\\n      title: \\"Claude Code Hooks Discussion\\",\\n      description: \\"Reddit discussion about Claude Code hooks support\\"\\n    }\\n  ]}\\n/>\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n*This revolution moves fast.

End-to-end? and for mobile too? and it auto heals / auto-adjusts when your codebase changes?\\n\\nWe share nuggets we learnt while building an AI Agent to solve one of the most persistent challenges in software development: making UI test automation accessible, reliable, and scalable across platforms and devices.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n\\n### The Problem\\n\\nTest automation has historically been:\\n\\n- **Too technical**: requiring code expertise\\n- **Time-consuming**: for authoring and maintaining scripts\\n- **Platform-limited**: with fragmented support for web vs. mobile\\n- **Fragile**: breaking with minor UI changes or incomplete user flows\\n\\nExisting tools were not built for the demands of today\'s fast-moving, multi-platform development cycles. They struggled particularly with hybrid apps, dynamic interfaces, and gesture-driven experiences.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### The Solution: AI Agent\\n\\nAI agent designed from the ground up as an intelligent, prompt-driven automation system with key capabilities:\\n\\n### Natural Language to Automation Code\\n\\nUsers describe test scenarios in plain English. It translates them into precise, executable test scripts\u2014including test data, validations, and edge cases.\\n\\n![flow-diagram](flow-diagram.png)\\n\\n### Web & Mobile App Testing\\n\\nSupports both web (Selenium, Playwright) and mobile (Appium) frameworks, making it one of the few solutions that bridges the gap between platforms seamlessly.\\n\\n### Multi-Language Support\\n\\nGenerates scripts in Java, Python, JavaScript, and other frameworks\u2014tailored to the team\'s existing tech stack.\\n\\n### Smart Debugging\\n\\nExecutes each script line in real-time as it\'s generated, identifying and correcting issues on the fly.\\n\\n### Cross-Device Execution\\n\\nRun tests instantly across 5,000+ combinations of real browsers and devices (when connected to cloud infrastructure).\\n\\n### Self-Healing Automation\\n\\nDetects and updates selectors and steps automatically as the application evolves, eliminating the need for manual maintenance.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Core Technical Challenges Solved\\n\\n### UI Automation for Flutter Web and Hybrid Mobile Apps\\n\\nMost automation tools break down on platforms like Flutter Web, where the UI is rendered inside a `<canvas>` instead of standard HTML elements, and on hybrid apps without accessible DOM trees.\\n\\n**Our agent solved this by enabling interaction with non-standard UIs using a combination of visual, contextual, and heuristic techniques**\u2014delivering true end-to-end automation where no other solution worked.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Accurate and Reusable Script Generation\\n\\nRunning LLMs for every test execution is expensive and error-prone.\\n\\nThis AI Agent implemented a **novel templating and generation system** that decouples script generation from execution. This allowed:\\n\\n- Complete and correct scripts on the first pass\\n- Reusability across test runs and frameworks\\n- Fast, low-cost, scalable test creation\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Complex Gestures and UI Behaviors\\n\\nSimulating gestures like pinch, zoom, drag-and-drop, or multi-touch is notoriously hard\u2014especially in custom components.\\n\\nThis agent provided **fine-grained control** over gesture simulation, going beyond the abstractions of typical libraries, enabling accurate testing of sliders, carousels, maps, and more.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Mapping Natural Language to UI Actions Reliably\\n\\nNatural language like \u201cClick the Pay button\u201d can be ambiguous\u2014especially in large, dynamic UIs.\\n\\n**Being very smart, it combined multiple modalities\u2014DOM structure, visual layout, and semantic cues**\u2014to reliably identify elements even when conventional locators failed. This enabled it to handle vague prompts and incomplete context with high precision.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Stability in Dynamic & Incomplete User Flows\\n\\nIn real-world apps, pop-ups appear unexpectedly, elements load asynchronously, and flows can be interrupted.\\n\\nIt was was designed to **recover intelligently** from such cases using retry logic, timeout strategies, and partial flow handling. This brought production-grade resilience to end-to-end test execution.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Scalable Evaluation & Debugging Infrastructure\\n\\nA major limitation of LLM-based systems is the lack of robust evaluation.\\n\\nAI Agent addressed this by building a **custom evaluation framework** that:\\n\\n- Validated script correctness at each step\\n- Enabled partial re-execution of scripts\\n- Provided fine-grained feedback for model improvement\\n    \\nThis drastically accelerated iteration speed and allowed for deeper validation of system accuracy.\\n    \\n\\n---\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nAI Agent redefines what\'s possible in test automation. By combining the reasoning power of LLMs with robust engineering for execution, gesture control, and UI resilience, it makes test automation accessible to non-engineers while retaining power for experts.\\n\\nFrom tackling the hardest UI platforms like Flutter Web to enabling precise, reusable test generation and execution at scale, our custom AI agent is a leap forward in the world of quality engineering.\\n\\nIt\'s not just a tool\u2014it\'s a full-stack AI agent that understands, adapts, and evolves with your application."}]}}')}}]);
